# Notes

## Rear axle

- Nut on non driven wheel can be tightened sufficiently to give some power
  transfer

## Steering column

- Adapted to make vertical (to avoid legs getting in the way)
- Needs a bushing between steering wheel and top of mount
  - 25mm for "normal" operation (i.e. steering operates between restricted range)
  - 16mm for extended operation (steering operates beyond restricted range, this
    can cause front tyres to get caught in front bumper, so maybe don't use it)
- Back of steering wheel is roughly 20mm across
